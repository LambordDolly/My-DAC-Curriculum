-- Refresher on how to perform basic query and how the database works:

-- SELECT Clause: everything = *

-- Select department table, the employee table and vendor table. Let's explore the database a little!



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- SELECT some columns:

-- Select only name, start time and end time.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- SELECT DISTINCT values: Unique column value

-- Distinct group names from department and businessentityid from jobcandidate



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- From different schemas: sales



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- LIMIT: As the name suggest it limits the number of *rows* shown at the end result

-- Limit the table productvendor to 10 rows and purchaseorderdetail to 100 rows



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- SELECT MDAS: Multiplcation/division/addition/subtraction

-- From the customer table Multiplcation/division/addition/subtraction the store_id



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--Q1: SELECT the DISTINCT title, last name, middlename and first_name of each person from the person schema. Return only 231 rows.
--A1;



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHERE clause: = 
-- gender is male


-- Only Research and Development


-- When dealing with NULL values


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHERE clause: Arithmetic filter

-- From customer table, territoryid = 4


-- From person table, emailpromotion <> 0


-- From employee table, vacationhours >= 99


-- From employee table, sickleavehours <= 20


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--WHERE clause: OR clause

-- From employee table, select either Design Engineer or Tool Designer


-- From product, select either Black or Silver


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHERE clause: AND clause

-- From Vendor, preferredvendorstatus and activeflag must be TRUE


-- From employee, gender must be Male and maritalstatus must be single


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--WHERE clause: Combined OR & AND clause

-- From the employee table pick either, marital status as single and gender male or marital status as married and gender female.


-- Example of poor formatting and logic.
-- From the salesperson table select territory_id either 4 or 6 and salesquota either 250000 or 300000

--Note: AND takes higher priority than OR

-- Reformatted version:
-- The importance of having good SQL formatting when writing your SQL code.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--WHERE clause: IN clause
--Q: Find all the employees whose birthdate fall on these dates.

-- '1977-06-06'
-- '1984-04-30'
-- '1985-05-04'



-- Find all the middle names that contains either A or B or C.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHERE clause: LIKE clause
-- The placement of the wildcard, %, affects what is getting filtered out.

-- From the person table, select all the firstname starting with a 'J'
-- Works very similar to excel find function

-- Find J

-- Only works for string!

-- But what if you know the number of letters in the firstname?

SELECT *

WHERE firstname LIKE 'J___';

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- What if we want firstnames that contains the letter a inside?


-- not tallying

-- We have two varying results, we can use things like UPPER() and LOWER() clause


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- WHERE clause: NOT clause

-- From the person table, lastname should not contain A in it.



-- From the employee table, choose middle name that contain

	3) So people don't think you are a noob

-- Q6: Can LEFT JOIN cause duplication? How?
-- A6:
/*
 It depends on the relationship that both the tables present for the left join share.
If it is a one-to-one relationship, the chance of having duplicates is unlikely.
However, if it is a one-to-many relationship, there could be a chance for duplicates to be present.

-- JOINS: CROSS JOINS

-- Explanation: A CROSS JOIN in SQL combines every row from the first table with every row from the second table. This type of join creates a Cartesian product,

-- A CROSS JOIN does not require any relationship or matching columns between the two tables.

-- Example: Good for arranging one person to meet multiple people

-- Explanation:
/*
A window function in SQL allows you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row. 
Unlike regular aggregate functions (such as SUM, COUNT, AVG), window functions do not group the result into a single output. 
Instead, they return a value for every row while using a "window" of rows to perform the calculation.
